# Circom circuit

## Explain circom

- Need to be done 2 things
  - declare signal
  - implement constrain

## Constrain and Assignment

- In circom, the <--, --> and = operators are assignments, whereas the <==, ==>, and === operators are constraints
- Assignments do not have to be followed for a valid proof to be created.
